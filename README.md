# 100-Days-Of-Code
My journey through Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: Python

ANYONE CAN COPY MY CODE, but please try to understand what the code is doing.
I am learning python as my second language. C# was the language I learned first.

If anyone needs help, shoot me a message at drpepperjazz@yahoo.com
